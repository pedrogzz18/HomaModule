run cp_vs_tcp --help in case you need help figuring out the arguments. One example is

last experiment was ran with
``` bash
./cp_vs_tcp -n 5 -w w5 -b 2 -s 30 --port-threads 1 --port-receivers 1 --tcp-port-receivers 1 --tcp-port-threads 1 --tcp-client-ports 1 --server-ports 1 --client-ports 1 -l ~/logs
```
to plot against homa and grpc in distbench, use the results_conversion script in dsitbench to obtain the overall summary for each test, and use the transform_files.sh script to copy them into the reports directory created by cp_vs_tcp script.

the transform_files script takes as arguments the path of the file obtained by the results conversion script, the name of the file we want to copy it into (which has to be either distbench_homa_w#, or distbench_grpc_w# Note: the -0.rtts at the end of the name is written by the script) and the last argument is the directory of the logs created by the experiments.

``` bash
./transform_files ${ANALYSIS_FILE_PATH} distbench_homa_w5 ${LOGS_DIRECTORY}
```

after copying the files, run 
```bash
cp_vs_tcp ${SAME_ARGUMENTS_AS_IN_THE_PAST_COMMAND} --plot-only
```

the pdfs will be inside the reports directory of the directory generated by cp_vs_tcp
